This code has a subtle bug related to how PHP handles array keys when using array_merge(). If the input arrays have overlapping numeric keys, the later array's value will overwrite the earlier one.  This is often unexpected when you're trying to combine arrays that might have some overlapping data.

```php
<?php
$array1 = [1 => 'apple', 2 => 'banana', 3 => 'cherry'];
$array2 = [2 => 'grape', 4 => 'orange'];

$mergedArray = array_merge($array1, $array2);
print_r($mergedArray);
?>
```
